pqm0td,xSypRo,Ender's Game is one of the best books I've ever read - Don't judge a book by its shitty back-cover summary,"I finished Ender's Game last week_ and what a brilliant book it is. It was sitting on my shelf for 2 years because I ordered it online and lost all interest in reading it after reading the back cover summary ""a 6-year-old trying to save the world from bugs"" made me think it's a book for 6yo.But I am so glad that I did. The story was great and the story-telling was superb, it kept my interesting trough the whole story, and made Ender feel relatable and real. Which is so rare in this genre that is dominated by 1 dimensional ""boring hero"" characters.The story of his growth and becoming more mature with each chapter, but still facing the same problems. Toward the end I was sure that there is a second book, because I thought there is no way they wrap it up in 50 pages, so it gave me a mind blown moment. Coming back to the game, to Peter, to his traumas and it all build up so perfectly toward the entire story, it's one of the most complete books I've read.This book has ruined my standards and I know future books going to let me down now in comparison to this one.",1631970103,15434,r/books,2048,1,,

pqx7ww,FromUpN0RTH_,Are we taking it too far?,"Me and my wife are minimalists for a few years now and are extremely happy with this way of life. Recently we did another declutter day and now we are at a point where we have almost nothing left. It’s not because we only want a certain amount of things or that we practice extreme minimalism but we now have only useful stuff left that we actually need although this is very little. Looking at our apartment now feels like we are extreme minimalist or don’t have the finances to buy anything ( although this is far from the case ). Our living room for example only has a big couch_ tv with pc attached for all our media, soundbar, huge plant and coffee table. Until recent we had a dining table but sold it because we never used it. Our bedroom has only a bed with storage build in for our clothes and our matras with sheets. Nothing more. The thing is, we feel like we only need this en we are happy with what we have . We don’t miss anything. I’m just worried that maybe we took it too far and don’t realise we are over doing it? That we try too hard to be happy with the little we have and it has become a mental issue. We absolutely don’t feel like this ourself but maybe we can’t see it realistic anymore?Are there other minimalists here who also have this little stuff just because they actually realise they don’t need more? Have you ever got to the point that after the declutter almost nothing was left?",1632008936,95,r/minimalism,48,,,

pqtlzq,Smash_Factor,Weight loss and common sense,"The first thing I want to say is that when we talk about ""weight loss"" or ""losing weight""_ we are not always talking about losing weight.What we're talking about is dropping the fat. That's the real goal here. We want to lose our extra body fat. It's the extra body fat that is causing us all the grief. We need to figure out a way to drop the extra fat.This is where the common sense comes in.\- **Your body will use the calories it needs and convert the rest of it into fat.**On the average, a person is going to burn approximately 1800 calories per day even with no exercise. From the moment you wake up until the moment you wake up the next day, your body will burn right around 1800 calories without exercise (varies a bit from person to person).So, if you're consuming 2800 calories during a single day, your going to end up with a surplus of 1000 calories in your body before you wake up in the morning.What do you think happens with that 1000 calorie surplus?Your body stores it as fat and saves it for future use.So now, you can see how easy it can be for a person to put on too much body fat. A person who eats 3000 calories per day on average for several months or even years, will have no choice but to convert those extra calories to fat unless they are working out vigorously. This is exactly how people who do not exercise get fat.Conversely, if you consume 1500 calories per day, you have a deficit of 300 calories in your body before you wake up in the morning. Since your body will burn 1800 calories per day with no exercise, where do you think it's going to get that extra 300 calories from that it needs?It takes it from the fat that you've stored.Which brings us to the next bit of common sense:\- **In order to drop extra body fat, you must burn more calories per day than what you put into your body per day.**This is not a debatable subject; it's a scientific fact. There is no way that you can consume 2500 calories per day, burn 1800 calories per day and somehow magically drop body fat without exercise. It simply is not going to happen. You can have a 2500 calorie per day diet and lose body fat, but you would need a vigorous work out plan in place that will burn off the extra calories above 1800 to exceed 2500 calories.This is how bodybuilders gain muscle. They consume a high volume of calories and convert it into muscle. That's different from the rest of us who typically convert those extra calories into fat.**- It does not matter if you are calorie counting your meals or eating according to macros.**The bottom line here, is that you will not drop the extra body fat unless you are burning more calories than what you consume. You can count calories or do macros; it doesn't matter. They both work.Fitness experts will often tell you to ditch the calorie counting and eat only according to a macronutrient diet (macros). This is fine and dandy, but it does not side-step the scientific fact that you must burn more than what you consume in order to drop fat.Fitness experts love to eat according to macros. The reason for this is that when you eat, the body is going to convert all the food into macronutrients (Proteins, carbs and fats). Since your body is going to convert everything over to macros anyway, you might as well eat according to the macros that your body is going to deal with. Toss in an effective work out plan and you should drop the extra body fat while also converting some of the fat into muscle. It's a good plan and a win-win!But not all of us want to work out, understand macros and can afford to pay a trainer to learn how it's done. This doesn't mean that your doomed! You can calorie count and eat healthy. Calorie counting and eating unhealthy are not synonymous with each other.**- Eat foods from all food groups every day.**Count the calories as accurately as you can, but make sure you are eating everything, every day. Eat the fruit, vegetables, proteins, grains, starch and healthy fats every single day. Get all of it and hit your target calories for the day. Your body will get what it needs from those foods and from the fat your body has stored.**- When we eat, we get full on the weight of the food, not it's contents.**This is common sense at it's best.The thing that gets us full, is the weight of the food. We don't fill up on macros such as carbs, proteins and fats. We don't fill up on the vitamins and other nutrients inside the food.What gets us full is the actual weight of the food itself and nothing more. You can fill up on anything.One pound of watermelon will get you just as full as one pound of pork egg rolls. The difference is that one pound of watermelon has about 140 calories, while one pound of pork egg rolls has probably 2000 calories.**- Get full on low calorie, high weight foods.**Don't get me wrong, you're going to eat foods that are low in weight and high in calories, but the bulk of your diet should consist of the opposite. Fruit, vegetables and grains have substantial weight to them but are low in calories. Look into the direction of foods that have low calories considering it's weight. Low calorie density foods are the way to go. You'll get full and satisfied while also avoiding the high calories. This is breakfast and lunch. Save the higher calorie foods for dinner (proteins and starch).\- SummaryYou won't drop fat unless you burn more calories than what you consume. Period. It's not a debatable subject. It's a scientific fact. It doesn't matter how you burn the calories. You can sit in front of a TV or computer all day long and still burn it off. You can also hit the gym mildly or like an animal and burn it off that way. It doesn't matter.Figure out how to eat healthy so that your body gets everything it needs, but consume less than what your body will burn. Do this, and you will drop the fat guaranteed even if you are sitting on your ass all day.Eat everything. Eat from all the food groups.The weight of the food gets us full. Focus on low calorie density foods to get full. Eat the high calorie density foods in moderation.",1631996049,99,r/WeightLossAdvice,21,,,

pqqi3y,TheFfrog,YSK that you should always look at your poop before you flush.,"Why YSK: I know_ it's nasty and it smells and you just wanna see it gone, but even a person with no medical training at all can easily notice some early signs of very serious health problems by just taking a second to look at their own poop.Certain unusual smells, consistencies and most importantly colors can be strong indicators that something is off, the most outstanding ones being if your poo is red or black.Both these colors usually indicate strong bleeding in the digestive system, black poo indicates a bleeding in the upper part of the digestive system while red is a bleeding in the final part. The difference in color is due to the fact that if the bleeding happens higher up the blood gets digested before ending up in your poop, getting a very peculiar blackish color, a jelly like consistency and a very strong horrible smell, while in rectal bleeding the blood wont have the time to be digested and will stay a vivid red, mostly liquid and won't smell that strongly.In both these cases, if you know you are actively pooping blood, you should immediately go to the hospital.GI (gastrointestinal) bleedings can be very dangerous on their own, and can also be strong indicators of other illnesses, such as Crohn disease, diverticulitis and intestinal cancer.[A nice read about this topic.](https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm#what_does_it_mean_when_your_stool_color_changes_in_color_texture_or_form)",1631985569,1336,r/YouShouldKnow,169,,,

I only turned on the laptop to apply to jobs and conduct video interviews and update my resume, aside from that I haven't touched it in weeks.I feel like buying that new laptop was a bit of a waste as I could've kept the old one as a backup somewhere in a cupboard for tasks that an iPad couldn't do.

I don't want to just lose the weight, I also want to achieve a healthy lifestyle, so I can keep the weight off, but also feel better overall. Almost entirely walking, as I said, but also some very light jogging (my knees are still in really rough shape), as well as stretching, situps, crunches, a bit of home weightlifting, etc.Well, this week was a major milestone for me, because for the first time ever, I walked for at least an hour every single day, and made it over 50km for the entire week. Normally I'm sure to do at least a half hour daily, but haven't been pushing too hard to go beyond that consistently, because I was afraid of burning out or causing knee trouble. But I got on a roll, and felt encouraged to keep at it.

pr108u,jj4646,[D] Can someone please suggest how to begin working on a problem like this?,"Suppose I have the following problem:https://imgur.com/a/hWNJWQvSuppose you access to the hospital records: you have the history about how different patients passed through the different ""stages"" of the hospital (each row represents a unique patient). A patient can enter the hospital_ and then meets the triage nurse. From there, they are sent to an examination room. If the condition is not serious, they are discharged from the hospital. If the condition is serious, they are sent to a proper hospital ward where they are kept there until they are discharged. However, if the patient enters the hospital in a very serious condition, then they are immediately sent to a ward and then discharged. I think that this problem can be modelled as a Markov Chain - either as a discrete time Markov Chain or as a continuous time Markov Chain. Using the available data, you can build a transition matrix which will describe the probabilities from moving between ""states"" (i.e. ""stages"") in the hospital. Once you have built the Markov Chain, you can calculate the probability the patient is in any of these ""states"" on the ""n-th"" day that they have entered the hospital.I am interested in something slightly different: When you look at this data, naturally you will see that the hospital does not admit only one patient at a time and then accept the second patient after the first patient has been discharged (i.e. dedicate the hospital to serving one patient at a time) - this would be crazy. Naturally, the hospital serves many patients - there are times when more patients might be transitioning between certain ""states"", and other times when fewer patients are transitioning between other ""states"". Naturally, the hospital can be more or less busy, and this will ultimately affect the ""speed"" at which patients will pass through the different ""stages"".Question: Can a Markov Chain be built in such a way that the transition probabilities are contingent on how many patients are in the hospital, how many patients are in each state and the rate at which they are transitioning? For instance, when a new patient arrives, the analysis could say: seeing as they are currently 100 patients in the hospital, 20 patients are waiting to see the triage nurse and 50 are in the exam room - the Markov Chain estimates you will have to wait approximately  10 hours before you might have your own room in the hospital ward?Is something like this possible?Thanks!",1632024504,3,r/MachineLearning,4,,,

pqmld2,myhandleforfitness,"Seeing my highest weight ever prompted me to join a super expensive, boujie gym yesterday","Currently - 187/F/35/5'3At 170 pounds in 2019 I was overweight but active as I commuted by bike to work 1.25 hours a day (fair weather permitting). Then lockdown hit and I became one with the couch. I joined a cheap gym (Blink)_ but almost never went. I feel undirected and bored going machine to machine weight lifting on my own. I am an extremely social person and feel much more motivated by being in a group setting where I follow someone's instructions. The offices have opened back up (just in time for my bike to get stolen but I'm getting a new one soon), and I've been going everyday. It's actually been nice taking the subway instead of biking - I don't come to work drenched in sweat, which is unpleasant for both me and my colleagues, and I get to read for a half an hour.Yesterday I stepped on the scale and saw that I had gained 17 pounds since March 2020 when we went into lockdown. My body weight increased by exactly 10%. I was devastated, and decided to do the most extreme thing I could think of that would give me the best chances of getting in shape: I joined Equinox. I know, I know, I'm going to have to cut back on a cappuccino or 50 to make up for it in my budget. But none of the cheaper gyms in the area have CLASSES. I want spinning classes, cardio classes, light weight classes, dancing or yoga or whatever they've got, just put me in a group with someone telling me what to do.People say that weight loss is 90% food and 10% exercise, but I've really found the opposite is true for me. In the past when I've had an organized exercise routine (cycling doesn't count - it's just a way to get around), it's been far easier for me to make healthier food choices. I have zero appetite after a workout, and I feel compelled not to ""ruin"" the hard earned calories I burned that day. I get into the mental state of being ""a fitness person"" as I engage in a certain ritual, if you will, at a certain time. Being immersed in this environment motivates me to conform to the culture of the people around me. Not sure if I'll going to go back to cycling to work or if I'll take the subway to save my energy for the gym and so I can keep my reading time. Either way I'm planning on milking this pricey membership for all it's got - another motivating factor. A spinning warm up if I don't bike, some sort of cardio class in the morning, and yoga after work. Have a made a huge mistake or has anyone else found the gym actually be the deciding factor in getting their weight back on track?

Right now I struggle with really bad low self esteem and my mental health is not exactly the greatest.

pr1b9l,AutoModerator,"Day 1? Starting your weight loss journey on Sunday, 19 September 2021? Start here!","**Today is your Day 1?**&#x200B;**Welcome to** r/Loseit!&#x200B;So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1_000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.&#x200B;# Why you’re overweight&#x200B;Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.&#x200B;# Before You Start&#x200B;The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.&#x200B;# Tracking&#x200B;Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)&#x200B;# Creating Your Deficit&#x200B;How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.&#x200B;The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.&#x200B;# Exercise&#x200B;Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.&#x200B;It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.&#x200B;# Crawl, Walk, Run&#x200B;It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.&#x200B;# Acceptance&#x200B;You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.&#x200B;Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.&#x200B;# Additional resources&#x200B;Now you’re ready to do this.

pr1i1e,bibliophile222,data from a lifetime of book cataloguing,"Okay_ well, not really a lifetime, but I've been keeping track of all the books I've read in chronological order since October 2003, when I was 17, and I also have a reasonably complete list of all the books I remember reading before that point. I don't use Goodreads but have a Moleskine notebook where I've been keeping track, and I've recently made a Google spreadsheet of all the books in case something happens to the physical copy.Anyways, I was interested to see how many books I've read from each time period. I've read a lot of classics and consider myself fairly well-versed in older works, so I wanted to see how true that really was. I found the publication dates for all 582 titles on my list, except that I gave rough estimates to old works without a publication year. The results are as follows:Works dated BCE: 3year 0 to 1000: 31000-1500: 31500-1600: 21600-1700: 71700-1800: 101800-1850: 191850-1900: 481900-1920: 201920-1940: 461940-1960: 561960-1980: 791980-1990: 711990-2000: 1112000-2010: 712012-2020: 302020 onwards: 2So, turns out that despite my love of classics, the bulk of my reading stems largely from all the middle grade fiction I read as a kid in the '90s, plus a lot of historical fiction that dates from 1950 onwards. 1996, when I was 10, was easily the most popular year with a total of 17 titles. I really thought I'd read more stuff from the 19th century and first half of the 20th! Some books also surprised me as being either older or newer than I'd thought. Some middle grade historical fiction that I'd assumed was from the 90s was actually from the 40s/50s, and there were a few books I could have sworn I'd read in 2001 that didn't come out until 2003.Okay, and now the question that hopefully keeps this from being labelled as a shallow post: who else has tracked their reading by decades? Have you noticed any patterns that weren't apparent at first glance? How do you feel about the numbers, and are there time periods you'd like to delve into more deeply? Is there any additional data I should harvest from my spreadsheet?",1632026757,5,r/books,8,,,
pqvgw8,nanocyte,Better syntax/semantic highlighting?,"Hi everyone_I've always had minor annoyances with the coloring in my editor. (I'm working with mostly React right now.) I usually ignore it, but when I start getting tired, I find myself screwing around with color themes and fonts quite a bit. I've been using Nord a lot recently, but sometimes I'll feel like there's not enough contrast, so I'll go back to Atom One Dark until that gets too noisy.I was recently reading an article by Kent C. Dodds, and I noticed the code examples are really nicely colored. Here's an example (there's a larger chunk of code in the middle of the page) [Kent C. Dodds: How to use React Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively)He's using PrismJS, but that's just for coloring code excerpts. I don't know if there's an easy way to adapt it to VSCode.I realized that it's not the color theme that's bothering me, but the consistency between different elements with the default settings on most (or maybe all) themes.For example, on the JSX element on the bottom, with the same color theme (Night Owl) in my editor, brackets, braces, and operators are all different colors, and the braces in regular JavaScript are a different color than the ones in the JSX. The prop name in the JSX is the same color as the element tag, so they tend to blend together in while looking at a bunch of elements.State is a different color in an object than it is in an array, while the dispatch method is the same. I mean, I think there are just generally a lot of unnecessary distinctions and also inconsistencies when I compare it to the code on the example page.I already know how to reassign coloring to different scopes and tokens, but I think if I start messing with that, I'm probably going to end up wasting a lot of time, not coming up with something that looks better, and then continuing to mess with it.Does anyone else been bothered by this, or am I just driving myself insane? Do you know of any good plugins to change the default token or scope assignments? (I think this may be a problem with my language settings rather than anything the theme designers did.)I'll probably just try to ignore this for now, but I feel like I can't be the only one who's bothered by this.",1632002419,1,r/vscode,2,,,

And a 2 mile jog in the evening.My workout timings are 5-6:30 am before I begin my day and a 2 mile jog after I end my day.I'm looking to be pointed in the right direction on my current situation that has seemed to have plateaued since I started working out. Am I doing something wrong? Because I was on the right track for those 4 months, losing just over 30lbs but stuck on a mere 8 lbs in 2 months at the moment.I'm really losing my mind as I can't figure out what am I doing wrong :(. I'm strictly following the diet as well, absolutely no changes to it at all.Also, I can't do ""super foods"" and whatnot or get me a personal trainer and all that pro stuff as I'm a college student on a budget lol.Would really really appreciate some advice on how I can get back on track to losing weight like I did because this current stagnant situation is making me lose my mind and demotivating me to reach my goals :( Thank you so much :)",1632026911,4,r/loseit,7,,,

I live with my sisters and when I watch them around food, it’s like there’s no temptation for them—no spell that makes them reach out. One of my sisters even forgets to eat meals sometimes, I could never. It’s like food is all I have in my mind. We had a nice spread out today for a friend who we haven’t seen in a while, and I spent the whole time thinking about the things on the table, and as I watched my sisters it was like there was nothing in front of them. Eventually I gave in and said to myself “I’ll just have 1 shortbread cookie, or 2 since that’s the serving size.” And I ate 7 shortbread cookies, chips, and half a bag of ritz crackers. I just couldn’t stop. Ironically, my mom came by and told one of my sisters “you look AMAZING! Are you losing weight?” (Both of my sisters are extremely thin, btw. I feel no hate or jealousy towards them in any way, just EXTREME curiosity as to HOW they can be in the same room as all these treats and not even look at them). But after my sister received that complement, I felt like a fat weak slob and wish I could undo all that I just ate. Does this happen to anyone else? What do you do to fight it?

pr2chk,crys1348,Weight loss with chronic illness/pain,"Hi all! I'm hoping someone can relate and offer me guidance. I have a few chronic illnesses that cause regular pain and exhaustion. The most problematic are chronic migraines. They're literally 24/7. It's very rare that the head pain dips below a 6. Working out makes it worse_ intensifying the throbbing pain, to the point I end up in bed sometimes with the blackout curtains closed. Plus the exhaustion from always fighting the pain and/or being in the prodrome phase. Some migraines also come with stomach issues, where the only things I generally can keep down are bland carbs with a very uniform texture. Ramen noodles, mac and cheese, etc.I'm at a loss on how to lose weight. I realize a huge workout and diet program isn't feasible, but there's got to be ways I can do this. So, I'd love to get feedback from people in similar situations. And yes, I do see a neurologist. I've been dealing with this for over 2 decades. No treatment has really helped, so I can't say ""when I feel better I'll work on my weight"". That day is most likely never coming, so I've got to be proactive where I am.

pr1wse,NiNi248,Weight Loss after an eating disorder?,"So I have struggled with an ED for a few years. It started when I was about 15. I have always been chubby_ since the age of 3 or 4. I simply loved eating too much. Despite my parents’ desperate attempts, I never lost weight long-term. They locked the fridge, hid food from me, took me to numerous dietitians since I can remember and all this did was make me extremely self conscious and think that something was wrong with me and I couldn’t trust myself around food. I “dieted” three or four times through my preteens with the help of a few dietitians, but I barely stuck to the plan and gained the weight back. At the age of 14, a lot of changes happened in my life. Immigration, parents’ divorce, etc, which really wrecked me. I decided to lose the weight once and for all. I weighed about 165-170 lbs at the time and was classified as “obese” due to my petite height.I downloaded my fitness pal and logged in my calories religiously (about 1200). I was fairly active at school and was still growing, so my deficit was too extreme. I kept cutting down food until I got to about 800 calories and eventually down to 500. I reached 93 pounds in 10 months. I was walking to school and from school to home, along with taking a dance class. All my hair was falling out, I had brain fog, was always cold, and always felt as if I was about to collapse. I was severely depressed and struggled with anxiety as well; just pressuring myself to get all A’s at school.  I was very suicidal at this time and stopped going to school for two months. I saw a doctor and got into therapy and psychiatric care. I was introduced to an “intuitive eating and Health at Every Size” dietitian who encouraged me to “honor my extreme hunger” and told me all food was “morally equal”.Well, I ended up binging a ton in “recovery”, and my dietitian kept applauding me.In a span of nine months I had gained  over 120 pounds. I had thrown away my scale and so I was shocked at how much weight I had gained. I couldn’t believe I was at 216 pounds after weighing merely 90 pounds. I was horrified and attempted to lose weight about three times in the span of a year. I ended up relapsing into restriction each time I tried to lose weight. I’m currently at 207-211 lbs and obviously none of my clothes or shoes fit. I can only shop in plus size sections since I wear a 1x and I have developed high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and my PCOS has worsened. I run out of breath walking at a brisk pace for a minute and my knees hurt. I need to lose some weight and am currently in a 200-300 calorie deficit as to not trigger the binge/restrict cycle. Aiming for about 2 lbs of weight loss a month. I would like to lose about 70 pounds by 2026. I know this is a long-term goal, but I want to lose weight as slow as possible.However I’m still scared of relapsing into either anorexia or binge eating. How do I manage my intake and movement without crossing the line into ED land? Is it even possible to keep the weight off? I feel scared and a bit lost. P.S. I’m still seeing a therapist so I’m getting help for the mental stuff :)",1632028700,3,r/loseit,1,,,

About halfway through I thought it was above average_ but Cummins was able to stick the ending and I upgraded it to 3.75/5 stars. (In my rating system: 4/5 is good. 3.75 is very close to being good, but just misses the mark.)The only reason why it garnered so much hate was because the author added a really dumb Author's Note at the end saying that she felt bad for not being ""brown enough"" to write this story. Also, she told a story about the fear of her illegal immigrant boyfriend getting deported as though it would be a veritable death sentence..... deliberately leaving off the fact that he was an illegal immigrant from *Ireland* and being deported would be an *inconvenience*.In other words, the controversy is mostly about the author and not so much about the book, and really, she brought it on herself. It's stereotypical? Maybe it is. You know what else is stereotypical? Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, another successful middlebrow novel. I don't think there was a single incident in the 20th century chapters that wasn't completely stereotypical, and Gyasi *flubbed* the ending, which made me end up rating it 3.5/5, above average, because I did like the chapters set in historic Ghana.",1632019742,6,r/books,4,,,

pqnj0y,Traditional_Bag6365,Large calorie deficit causes a plateau?,"I initially started losing weight by eating the ""recommended"" 1200 calorie a day diet. Sometimes less_ sometimes just a tiny bit more. But always within that range. Worked great, lost around 30 lbs. Then it just stopped. I wasn't losing weight despite still eating in that range and exercising regularly. My body just said NO, we're staying right here. I had both a nutritionist and my personal trainer tell me I needed to be eating more. Especially in light of how much I now work out. That's honestly been a hard pill to swallow. We've always been conditioned to think  a simple ""calories in, calories out...and the bigger the deficit the better"". But appears it's not the case. I still maintain a deficit, just a smaller one. I had read that 500-1000 deficit a day results in weight loss. Period. And that if I wasn't losing weight anymore, it MUST be because I am eating more than I think I am. Which is bullshit. I track and measure everything. But on any more than maybe a 500-600 deficit, I don't lose weight anymore. Worked at first, but stopped. Our metabolism drops when our bodies are deprived of enough nourishment. Caused a total stall for me. I've started losing again, but VERY VERY slowly.

pqqje3,eelsause,My Story,"(Long post_ sorry)Howdy! I’m F(18) and I’ve been seeing a lot of people on here before, but never posted myself. Ever since I was little, I have always been in the 99 percentile of obesity. I have done many diets before, have repressed my own fashion sense as a result of my weight (pear shaped stomach fat if you understand that), and have rebounded so much so that I have grown larger than my mother (we are both obese) due to COVID-19. I scared the jeebus out of her and it was written on her face… she never sugarcoats things, so I knew it was bad.Since then, it’s been rather hard to have hope from everything I’ve tried in the past. Keto, protein shakes, pescatarian, vegetarian, fasting, you name it, I’ve done it. (I haven’t abused my throat and made bathroom trips after each meal, for those wondering.) All of them failed horribly (stomach issues + stress + depression) or weren’t sustainable for the long run.I recall myself around 200 lbs at my lowest when I was most active, running 3.5 miles a day for 30 minutes (sometimes doing weights for about 20 more) about 3-4 times a week, and my school at the time before the pandemic had a lot of floors every day that I had to walk up… maybe about twice a day. I wasn’t thinking terribly much about food, only that I remember portions being smaller and that it wasn’t like anything super greasy. But it felt great and I felt way better about myself.(My calves hurt like a bitch when they cramped at night though.)…But now I’m scared to fail again if I start that journey. I’m tired of failing this part of my life and now with college, my mental stamina is at an all-time low for it. It’s not just other things now, the blame is entirely on me.I’m not asking for anything, I just… am I still able to do this and make it out the other side? Am I right to be worried?

My weight fluctuated between 203lbs-215lbs. So was on YouTube a week ago and came across ""the egg diet"" where you eat boiled eggs an apple and oatmeal daily with green tea. Its a temporary diet to get you out of a plateau or off a sugar addiction.I started this diet 2 days ago at 203.8lbs and this morning my weight was 199.6lbs. I have not been below 200 since before I had kids... I read up on some people who have tried it as well and they said they kept the weight off since they continued a keto diet for maintenance. I will probably do a total of 5 days on this diet and then go keto and try the egg diet again in October if the weight stays off during my maintenance period.

Or is it perhaps a dormancy in darker times that uses just enough energy to survive no matter how large the plant is?What sparked this question was me thinking about recommendations to sometimes bring houseplants outside during the summer so they can grow more. But then_ once you bring them back inside, won't they suffer from the sudden reduction in light? And I thought about plants in general during differing seasons. The plant grows larger over the years, and the climatic conditions stay relatively similar over the years (including the amount of sunlight). The roots grow, so the amount of nutrients absorbed can increase. And in terms of sunlight, more leaves develop in the growing season to absorb sunlight. It must mean those plants still have enough energy absorbed from the leaves on the plant in the dark season. Or, if the leaves drop as the dark season approaches, then the plant must have enough energy in the plant to survive until more sunlight arrives.",1632041798,2,r/houseplants,0,,,
pqya54,Userfound22,I am morbidly obese and having foot pain when when doing more “extensive” activities. Is this normal when being overweight or is something else wrong?,"Hello_I am asking this question because there is so many activities I loved as a lighter adult. Currently I am 6’ 2” and 360lbs. I have been trying to get into activities I loved when I was younger to help promote exercise. Specifically, the activities I am talking about would be rollerblading, snowboarding, and skateboarding.Originally, I never had issues until a  couple years ago when I tried snowboarding (around 330lbs). I had really bad foot cramps/pain and I assumed it was my snowboard boot. Although, years before I never had these issues. I assumed maybe the boot was too small or too loose. Cue last year, I tried roller blading and had the same issues. Again, I assumed the boots were too small or too loose. Then… recently I tried skateboarding again and I had shoes that were more than a perfect fit. Again… I experienced the same pain. At this point I had no idea what it could be. I tried fitting everyone loose, tight, and in between. Has anyone had these same issues before and noticed a difference at a much lighter size?

pqy67q,ulnessity,I want to lose weight incredibly bad but I lack self discipline.,"I (16F) stepped on the scale today after months only to be completely and utterly shocked. I currently weigh 240 Ibs_ though I was so baffled because I look no different than when I was 200 or less. most people tell me I pass for around 160-170 because I am tall. I was expecting the same number. I am 5’11 so I understand that height has a factor in how weight is distributed and that taller people weigh more, though 240 is still extremely overweight and unhealthy regardless of how I look. I don’t want to lose weight just for health, but I also want to be confident in my skin; in which I never have been.unfortunately emotional eating has been a huge factor in this and I snack when I am upset or stressed and especially bored. 90% of the time i’m not eating because i’m hungry. I have tried a multitude of things- myfitnesspal, dieting, calorie counting, working out, eating healthier, journaling, small goals etc only to be doing them for a week and then losing motivation or self discipline which leads me right back to my same old habits. I will tell myself that I have to lose weight no matter what, but then when I am actually presented with food, all urges win and I give in. I am mortified of becoming like someone on 600 Ib life because what i’m doing is how all of them started out, not to mention I’m tired of hiding my body under baggy clothing and risk for diabetes. on most days I will drink tea for breakfast and then go to school, have school lunch, then come home and snack a ton with zero portion control until dinner, which is again unhealthy because I have no control on what my family buys from the store. the pantry and fridge is filled with junk because no one else in the house has weight issues besides me. so as you can see I have little control over what kind of food I am actually eating because I am not the one buying it. not an excuse, just an explanation.at this point i’m desperate to keep up motivation and self disciplining myself along with portion control. any advice is greatly appreciated; this madness needs to end before I get any fatter.",1632012754,3,r/loseit,10,,,

If I eat anything else I will be, but for now I'm good.When I was logging my food, I realized I was not over and immediately thought ""Oh! that means I can have something else!""

It is exciting because maybe I can figure out how to pay attention to those long forgotten queues and actually eat like a normal, healthy person.Funny thing, which is kind of related and kind of not, I also realized I have an addictive relationship with food.  I know I should only eat when I am actually hungry(once I realize when that is lol), but I found myself wanting to continue to eat this weekend even after I was uncomfortably full. I was sitting there watching TV feeling miserable because I was so full, yet I was still thinking ""Once I'm not so full, I think I want (fill in various snacks/food)"" . And to make it worse, I told myself I would just exercise the extra food off, so it would be okay. Even as I told myself that, I knew it wasn't true, it was just food junkie rationalization!

pqny6j,BlastBanger,Can't seem to lose weight.,"Hello_ I am writing this to try to understand if I am doing something wrong and need to change or if it is just expected. Now, for the details. I am just a guy around 108KG, 1.76m tall, 25 Years old. I have tried healthy habits before (I do not want to call it dieting since it is something I want to do for life instead of a brief period), with more success, managing to drop from 110 to 98 KG. 2 years later I gained them back, mostly due to personal reasons and quarantine. The past couple of months I have dedicated myself on improving my health and body. I am visiting a nutritionist and we have made an eating plan and working out. 2 months and counting I have lost 1 kilogram, following a very strict schedule. I eat 4-5 meals per day, with very good macros and pretty healthy. A simple oatmeal with fruits for breakfast. Maybe another fruit or some yogurt a bit later. For lunch, usually half a plate of any kind of carbs (around 100g cooked rice/pasta/potatoes) with chicken or turkey (also around 100g), and a lot of salad on the side. No unhealthy dressings or too much salt, just very basic things like olive oil and balsamic vinegar. After I might eat another fruit or a protein bar mixed with my workout. And in the night usually the same as lunch but without the carbs and maybe a bit less. All in all, I change these every day, but this would be the ""average"" food.My workouts are mostly full body. They can range from 10 to 40 minutes depending on the intensity. I try to exercise at least 5 times a week. So, I have seen some improvements. With my nutritionist, we saw I dropped 0.8% fat and gained 2.5kg of muscle, sitting around 75KG of muscle. However I do not lose weight. After 2 whole months, even if I rebuild some muscles, I have lost only 1 KG. At this rate, to lose, let's say 20KG I would need like 2 years... My nutritionist, although very good, is as perplexed as myself. With worst diets, I have lost much more weight. This does not add up... If anyone can give me some insight, some info, anything to be honest, I would really appreciate it. Also, I forgot to mention, I am drinking lots of water, 3+ Liters per day, maybe 4 on workout days with high intensity.Thank you for patience.",1631977092,13,r/loseit,24,,,

pqvucx,another_wordsmith,"The Starlight Barking, or The 101 Dalmations sequel where the dogs become flying telepaths","When a friend told me that this existed_ I knew that I'd found my newest rabbit hole. The original author of 101 Dalmatians wrote a sequel, eleven years after the original, and made it feel like a child-friendly version of the Book of Revelation. It's also incredibly engaging and worth your time.The surreal entertainment value comes from the simplicity of the premise. One day, all non-dogs in the world become trapped in magical sleep. Pongo and Missis, the lead dogs from 101, try to understand what happened. This naturally leads to the discovery that no dogs are hungry, they have gained the ability to fly, they can communicate across dozens of miles, and doors open for them if they think about it.These discoveries occur as Pongo and company go to London to see Cadpig, the Prime Minister's Dalmatian who's become de facto leader of England.Perhaps the strangest part of it is that this all creates a genuinely good read. Details of flight, telepathy, and the formation of a dog government all work in the logic of the story. There's a consistency of tone that turns the madness into worldbuilding. Pongo and co need to learn how to fly. They spend time figuring out the logistics of telepathy. Ample time is given to show that there's some kind of magic to ensure that no sleeping creature will undergo harm.Each chapter adds a new layer. Author Dodie Smith paced out the absurdity so that it's never overwhelming. That absurdity is most compelling for the way it's presented. The story is written in a casual, matter-of-fact way. Such candid prose makes the bizarre elements hit harder. For example, the third chapter features Pongo and Missis trying to find a dictionary so they can look up the meaning of the word 'metaphysical'. The only problem is that they can't really read, because they're dogs. So, after circumstance opens a dictionary to the correct page, they can only understand a small handful of words. This culminates with ""I think metaphysical is a kind of magic.""Props to Dodie Smith for making an entertaining scene out of dogs opening a dictionary. This lavish detail on the surreal mundane kept me invested in the characters, who wanted to understand the situation as much as I did.The prose sometimes achieves entertainment from the opposite: quick bursts of madness that happen before moving on to something new. This can perhaps best be seen in the line: ""Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a strong force of Dalmatians with you. I may form a private army."" For the record, this sentence does make more sense in context, but the fact that there is a context where this sentence can make sense speaks to my point.I don't want to give any major spoilers because I think you should read this. Dodie Smith's prose is brilliant. The worldbuilding is rich. The story is peppered with little gags about British culture that I thoroughly enjoyed. It also creates mental images like a boy on a tractor being carried through the air by flying Dalmatians like he's Elijah being taken to Heaven in a flaming chariot.My final thought on the book is the same as my first: why hadn't I heard of this before? There's a goldmine of material for book YouTubers and essayists. I've had to restrain myself in talking about the Starlight Barking because I simply want to tell people about the book rather than overanalyze it. I think channels like Amanda the Jedi or Dom Noble could make incredibly entertaining videos from this.More importantly than that, however, I implore you to give this book a try.

pr15en,80hdthrowawy,college has fucked up my relationship with food,"I’m (f19) currently a sophomore in college and I’m the biggest I’ve ever been at about 340-350lbs/5’6. I don’t weigh myself often because it makes me unbelievably anxious and weighing myself can be traumatic at times having grown up my entire life overweight/obese. However_ at the beginning of quarantine (March 2020) I remember weighing myself a couple times and being around 315-320lbs, so seeing the difference after my freshman year of college really shocked me. I’m aware of the ""freshman 15"" but I figured that because I was literally sitting on my ass and eating all day for nearly a year in quarantine, the change of environment on campus would kind of have the opposite effect. I was walking over a mile every day to and from class (baby steps ofc since I wasn’t active whatsoever beforehand), I didn’t have a car so I wasn’t eating out like I did during quarantine, I often times would skip meals to avoid the walk to and from the dining hall, I started hiking every now and then since there were some nature trails next to my campus etc. While I wasn’t being very intentional in my weight loss, I thought I still might see some positive change since my routine was different. At the same time, my diet changed drastically (which I now know directly contributed to my weight gain). Before my freshman year, I’d been pescatarian for about 2 years. Within my first couple weeks, campus dining had me damn near starving myself since every entree had red + white meat in it and our only other restaurant on campus is a Chick Fil A Express (shortened menu without the salads etc). As a result, I decided I’d just go ahead and eat meals containing white meat which gave me access to the Chick Fil A and some of the more hearty entrees in the main dining hall. I started buying myself snacks as well to have in my dorm for when I didn’t want to walk to the dining spots on campus. Having 24/7 access to my own snacks definitely contributed to my binging habit. All of these influences pretty much fucked up my relationship with food and put me into two situations: Absolutely zero appetite vs. RAVENOUS. As a broke college student who was too lazy to walk to the campus dining areas, often times I’d just settle for sleep for dinner. I’d eat in the morning and starve for the rest of the day into the night, just to wake up in physical pain from not eating anything. I’d go straight to the dining areas and eat as much as I could so I ""wouldn’t be hungry later"" just to end up in the same cycle. I’d eat out of boredom and end up emptying the shelf full of snacks in my dorm that was supposed to last me a week. It’s hard to explain but now it’s put me into the mindset where I have to eat as much as I can away from campus since I know I won’t have the same opportunities to eat on campus. When I’m home for the weekend I’m reminded of all the food I have direct access to, so I take advantage of it because I know when I get on campus I’m gonna starve again. It’s fucked up the way I look at food. I genuinely can’t tell when I’m hungry. I eat when there’s nothing else to do, I eat when my stomach is in shambles from starving myself, I binge in hopes that it’ll keep me full. I have a car now so I’m not walking nearly as much, I have the ability to eat out when I want, I’m spending money I don’t have almost completely on food. I’m scared I’ll end up in the same situation I was in my freshman year but 1000x worse. I can’t tell if I’m posting this for sympathy or if I just want to tell someone. On the bright side, now that I have a car, it opens up the opportunity for me to drive to and from a gym (let’s hope I can get over my fear or working out in public) and I can find healthier options when eating out. Even then, my relationship with food needs to change and I don’t really know where to start.",1632025134,1,r/loseit,2,,,
pqodmw,khalidsaifullaah,[N] A talk on DALL·E mini architecture (VQ-GAN + BART pipeline understanding),"I've recently given a talk on our DALL·E mini. It's more on its theoretical aspect rather than the technical ones. **It Provides a beginner-friendly understanding of the modules used_ VQ-GAN and BART.**[**\[YouTube Link\]**](https://youtu.be/ui0X6ozE3bI)&#x200B;**Talk Abstract**:*The ability to control image generation with natural language is very fascinating and opens a lot of new opportunities in the field of multimodal machine learning. OpenAI's recent blog about their DALL·E project shows the potential of models, but unfortunately, the model has not been released. As we know these state-of-the-art models require massive amounts of computation and parameters to train, our goal here with DALL·E mini is to show that one can still achieve reasonable performance on this multimodal task with far more accessible means of compute. Even though DALL·E mini is about 30 times smaller than the original and trained on a much smaller dataset, it demonstrates interesting zero-shot capabilities.  In this talk, we will get to know DALL·E mini in detail, and explain how it is capable of achieving such results thanks to the use of pre-trained models such as the VQ-GAN and BART. We will dig deeper into the theoretical aspects of these models to understand what happens under the hood in the DALL·E mini pipeline.*",1631978538,4,r/MachineLearning,0,,,
pqta5w,Anything1069,“Book Hangover”: The Vanishing Half,"All summer I’ve been screenshooting images of books I’d love to read. I’ve never really been a deep reader_ in elementary school I fell in love with this fantasy book series which was centred around kids my age but didn’t even finish the series. In middle school the only book I read and actually liked was The Hate U Give, it offered the perspective of a teenage black girl which was so fresh to me because even though I am one, I barely see that perspective through media etc. The last time I read something by choice was last January when the show Bridgeton came out, my mom and I liked the show and she had copies of the books from years ago so I read it, while waiting for a second season. The books were not huge in size but I was impressed that I could finish a book in 2 or 3 days. I watched zoom book club meetings about it until I finished. Then I set a goal to read more and that goal obviously fell out. But during the summer I thought about reading again and watched/ read book reviews about books I was curious about. The Vanishing Half was one of those books. It wasn’t high up on my list (which I can’t believe now that I’ve read it), but when I showed my schools librarian all the books I was curious if the school had, it was one of the books.I started reading on Monday and finished it yesterday (Friday). I read it right before classes, during my spares in the library and for a bit after school. It was always glued to my hand to the point that classmates and friends who were around me would ask basically daily. I had this whole plan of how I would finish the book. Wake up early and walk to sit on this bench beside this lake that’s under a bridge that I love, but I couldn’t help myself and I finished it Friday after school in bed. I must’ve read the last paragraph like five times, I couldn’t believe it was over.I read books and envision it like a really long movie and I’m not the fastest reader (it didn’t help that I reread paragraphs just so I could envision things clearer). When I think of photography I can’t help but think of Reese or try to watch greys anatomy I think of Jude. I hope they’re okay and I can’t believe they are not real. I truly think they exist somewhere in the world😫. I felt so empty knowing it was over and woke up this morning craving more. I watched interviews with Brit Bennett but I still felt sad. I tried to research what I was feeling and I saw the term book hangover. If this is true then it should be over in like a week or two, but I can’t imagine feeling any other way, with this book being over.I’ve come up with a few reasons why I felt so much about this book. I think the fact that it was written by a black woman and written about black women was one of the reasons. I liked that the characters were dimensional and I saw different things in them that I see in myself and the women around me. When Frantz came up in the book it was just something that I felt no one could write more accurately because guys like him exist. It was just little details like him that made the book feel so real. Little details like that sprinkled in the book that made me feel so heard and seen.I get that some people didn’t like the ending but I love reading/ watching things that don’t have the ending I expected. It feels more like real life that way. I only want to know how everyone is doing. I only want more. I just want to talk to someone or people about the book. I’ve recommended it to so many people. I also get that this whole thing might be a bit dramatic and it’s just me being a teenager, but I’m convinced this is the first time I’ve loved a book. Any tips or advice anyone has to offer? Or just things about the book anyone has to say? I’ve never mourned anything before (which I’m grateful for) but it feels like I’m mourning this book. I can’t believe I’m going to return it.",1631994933,6,r/books,7,,,

A good adventure novel should have stakes and peril and a good antagonist sure. But you could argue that many adventure books have these qualities.

pqu1cc,JenMor23,So sensitive,I'm feeling ultra sensitive about my weight loss efforts and this is my biggest barrier. I think that I have always had a weight stigma and this has been the thing that I have struggled with the most. I know the science and logical understanding in reducing intake/calories and upping my exercise/movement i.e. CICO. This never seems to stick for me. I can never sustain a lifestyle that follows these principles. This is where I get stuck in a cycle of failure. So I start off with the best intentions and am committed 100% then within a week or two I flounder. It is a self perpetuating relapse of hatred and disappointment. I am my own worst critic yet I take every comment from my husband and family so seriously. I know that my efforts have never materialised with any significant weight loss so how can I expect any support. It always feels like every time I declare that I am going to focus on and tackle my weight he reads it as 'here we go again' another failed attempt it won't last and I take it so personally that I can feel the disappointment brewing before I even try! I have never expressed my feelings like this before but I really want to know how do I get past this? Any help gratefully accepted.,1631997499,3,r/loseit,2,,,

Im 5 ft and currently weigh around 56kg. I used to weigh 64kg, I say 10kgs cause I had gone down to 55kg but gained muscle now so Im at 56kg. I keep trying to lost some more fat, not necessarily weight, with CICO like I used to...but it seems anything I try at the moment I get hit with low blood sugar or else with migraines whenever I fast or eat a bit less than usual etc. Im technically at a good weight, but Im naturally quite stocky and build up muscle pretty easily so I guess I look bulkier than I actually am cause of it and ngl it does bother me. Most girls want that tiny slim look I guess hah. But my question is has this happened to anyone where you just had to say maybe my body just doesn't wanna budge anymore? Maybe I should just take it really slow, keep building muscle and eventually it should replace fat because of an eventual higher metabolism from the muscle? Like I question whether I should just keep exercising and eating a normal healthy amount and just, stop trying to lose more fat. My body fat is probs around 20% rn. I calculated a while ago so Im judging off of that.

pqq19b,hurdygurdyhare,Tolstoy's The Resurrection," It may not be War & Peace or Anna Karenina but it’s a good novel_ unfairly overlooked. If you ever wanted to recreate late19th century Russian society you could do it perfectly just reading Tolstoy. This book fills in a part of it not really covered in the other books: the criminal justice system. His views are very much relevant to present day American society. Alternate sentencing, recidivism vs. rehabilitation, overcrowding, biased sentencing, even domestic terrorism were the same issues Tsarist Russia struggled with. He must have done a lot of research because his command of the law and its detailed procedures is impressive. I learned that able bodied prisoners had to walk from Moscow to Siberia for their exile. They must have had great cardio by the time they reached their destination. Some readers will find all the details too much. The plot is mainly the hero Nekluhdov trying to save his former lover from the criminal justice system but in doing that, he gets involved in several other court cases and those get to be very hard to follow. Tolstoy’s style here tends to be very gossipy. All the minor characters have scandals in their backgrounds that Tolstoy has to tell us about even though we may never see this character again. Some of the characters that influence the plot are introduced very late and are barely sketched in. I couldn’t keep track of everyone and just focused on the two main characters but I feel like I lost a lot doing that. You probably wouldn’t use this book to teach a creative writing course. There is a lot of telling rather than showing but I don’t mind that too much. Tolstoy’s warmth and humanity are evident on every page and make up for any technical flaws. This guy had a heart as big as Russia. The Wikipedia page for The Resurrection says that the characters are one dimensional. I down’t get that at all. It describes how both main characters transform into something different than their society groomed them for. That is the opposite of one dimensional. The book ends like it should but it is rather abrupt and I would have liked more information on Nekluhdov’s later life. But still a satisfying read.",1631984029,8,r/books,3,,,

Body is satistied in that instant and would rather leave that 1/4 of meal for later on (probably as a leftover snack?). \-Final, body is readjusting itself and truly telling that I’m satisfied even when I’m not finishing my whole plate.

Now, as beautifully as this book is written, the subject-matter (memory / forgetfulness, and early 20th century British culture) wasn't appealing to me. If I had an uncle that would speak like that -- trying to tell a story in a roundabout way -- I'd urge him by saying, ""get to the point!"" or something to that effect.It made me think a bit about my reaction to *Never Let Me Go*, where there, too, I had hard time with the narrative (overall I did like that novel, though). **Maybe I am not a big fan of Ishiguro after all?**I am curious to hear if other people had this kind of change-of-heart regarding this author, or others.",1631993902,3,r/books,11,,,

pqjloo,sylsau,[Text] Pursue Excellence Rather Than Focusing on Success Is the Best Way To Succeed Without Stress. Focus your efforts on what you can control.,">""If you focus on success_ you'll have stress. But if you pursue excellence, success will be guaranteed."" *-Deepak Chopra*You want to succeed. You have very ambitious goals that you want to achieve in your lifetime. The sooner the better. To achieve your goals, you have defined plans and strategies that you follow to the letter daily.However, success is slow in coming. You realize that the overnight successes you see in the media are just smoke and mirrors.Seeing other people succeed in obtaining the results you are aiming for much more quickly than you begin to discourage you. You feel certain stress. You wonder if your turn will ever come.After all, if these people have managed to achieve in only one year the success you've been aiming for more than 5 years, your chances of success seem very slim.Added to this stress is social pressure. People around you keep asking you where you are in achieving your goals. At first, you answer honestly, but with time, you almost start to feel ashamed.This downward spiral handicaps you more than anything else, but you don't know how to get out of it.If you think about it, there is a solution to your problem. This solution is a major shift in your worldview. Instead of focusing solely on success, you need to focus all your effects on the pursuit of excellence in everything you do.This advice seems trivial, but you will find that very few people actually do it.Too obsessed with the will to succeed, most people put the cart before the horse. They focus only on their goals without doing what is really necessary for their daily lives.The best thing to do is to start with your goal and break down all the steps that will help you achieve it. Then you should aim for excellence in each of those steps. Having this breakdown in small intermediate steps will boost your motivation like never before.With each success, you will continue to keep the motivation to be excellent. You can control the level of excellence you want to achieve. Not when success will come. So focus only on what you can control: you and your efforts.Instead of wasting time looking at what others are doing, you will focus on your next step to achieve. Step by step, you'll get closer to your big goal without even realizing it. The one that gives meaning to everything you do.A goal that gives purpose to your life is so big that you can't use it every day to stay motivated. Why not? Simply because it seems too far away.When you climb a mountain, it's not the summit you should be looking at, but the next intermediate stop. All your efforts must be concentrated on reaching this first point. Once you have reached this point, you will move on to the next. This way, you will be able to give it your all every time.**Final Thoughts**Pursuing excellence every day is like climbing a mountain.By following this approach, your success will be guaranteed. Better yet, you will not feel the stress that ruins your life and penalizes you in the achievement of your goals. So now you know the approach you need to follow to lead a more fulfilling life: it's the pursuit of excellence.Success will come as a positive consequence of the excellence that you will have tried to achieve daily over a long period of time.*First published here:* [*https://sylvainsaurel.substack.com/p/pursue-excellence-rather-than-focusing*](https://sylvainsaurel.substack.com/p/pursue-excellence-rather-than-focusing)",1631958847,3,r/GetMotivated,2,,,
pqkwta,peaceiseverystepp,[Tool] One kind act that will change the world,"Human beings are naturally altruistic_ we want to help someone when we see that they’re struggling. Its also good for our mental health as well - when we help others it builds our confidence, makes us feel more optimistic about our own lives.So if that's true why don’t we live in a utopian world? There’s not an easy answer to this. Part of the reason is lack of awareness - if we saw someone on our doorstep who was suffering we’d want to help them. But much of the suffering in the world happens away from our direct view, so we sometimes have to actively look for who needs our help.Another reason is that we can unconsciously judge people as being worthy or less worthy of our compassion. Its very easy to empathise with people that we like but developing your empathy means not limiting it to the perceived deserving. Thinking about someone you don’t get along with and meditating on their life experience, their challenges and building our understanding helps us to let go of our resentment and wish them well.A final reason is cultural. Depending on where you live, then your society might be more individualistic or collective. There’s good things about individualist societies, freedom of choice for example, but society can start to lose its connection between human beings when self interest pushes our collective altruism aside.So what's the solution? We can pick a person each day who needs our help, it might be someone you know, someone suffering in another country, someone left behind by society - and provide some understanding and practical help to them. It might be that you listen to them without judgement, do something kind for them or share your time or resources. The person we choose might be someone we wouldn't normally feel empathy for - see how it feels to make a difference in their lives. A kinder world is possible and within reach. Some might tell you its pie in the sky, that it’s a hard world and you have to be tough to survive but society doesn't have to be harsh. The world that I want to live in is one where we take care of each other and ourselves - we start that by looking for the difference we can make, even if we feel we're not always treated kindly ourselves. Helping others is a fundamental pillar to our own happiness and we can make it happen right now.[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/one-kind-act-that-will-change-the-world/id1493806566?i=1000535844804)[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/One-kind-act-that-will-change-the-world-e17hg0j)",1631965337,2,r/GetMotivated,1,,,
